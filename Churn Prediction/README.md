  - Gender: Mostly Female
  - Age: 20‚Äì50
  - Tenure: < 12 Months
  - Payment Method: Credit Card, Bank Withdrawal
  - Contract Type: Month-to-Month
- **Top Churn States**: Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu
- **Service Factors**: Lack of device protection and online security correlates with higher churn

- **Features Used**: Gender, Age, Tenure, Monthly Charges, Contract Type, Internet Service, etc.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: `86%`
 
## üìä Visual Dashboards

Interactive dashboards were created using **Power BI** to translate complex churn prediction results into business-friendly insights. These dashboards enable easy interpretation of customer behavior and risk segmentation.

### üîç Prediction Dashboard

Displays predicted churners along with demographic breakdowns such as gender, age group, marital status, state, payment method, and contract type.  
It helps identify high-risk customer segments for targeted retention efforts.

### üìà Churn Summary Dashboard

Provides detailed churn rate analysis across various dimensions including:

- **Demographics**: Age, gender, marital status  
- **Account Info**: Contract type, payment method, tenure  
- **Geography**: Churn rate by top states  
- **Services Used**: Impact of services like internet, phone, and backups on churn  
- **Churn Reasons**: Categorized by competition, dissatisfaction, pricing, and more
